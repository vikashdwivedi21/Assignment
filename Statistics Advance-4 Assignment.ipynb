    "A confidence interval is a range of values that is used to estimate an unknown population parameter with a certain level of confidence. It provides a measure of the uncertainty or precision associated with the estimate.\n",

    "You decide to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height.\n",

    "First, you determine the critical value for a 95% confidence level. For a sample size of 100, the critical value is approximately 1.96 (obtained from a standard normal distribution table).\n",

    "Next, you calculate the margin of error using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Margin of Error = Critical Value * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the margin of error is 1.96 * (5 / √100) = 0.98 cm.\n",

    "\n",
    "Confidence Interval = Sample Mean ± Margin of Error\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Interval = 175 ± 0.98\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for the average height of adult males in the city is (174.02 cm, 175.98 cm). This means that we can be 95% confident that the true population mean height falls within this range."
